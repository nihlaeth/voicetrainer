MIDI voice exercises made convenient

## About
I'm a singer and I have a disability that prevents me from using a keyboard (musical or otherwise). Since speech recognition and making music are a really bad combination, I could pretty much only do voice exercises during my singing lessons, which frustrated me to no end.

So I started thinking about a solution. What I want from this is an exercise that I can easily change into a different tempo or key. It should be trivial to pause, repeat, or change the parameters. Everything has to be operable by mouse alone. And it should be quality MIDI, because I can't stand the sinus tone that most MIDI sequencers emit. Also, I want sheet music. Beautiful sheet music, preferably with lots of notes (the textual kind). And it shouldn't be hard to add new exercises, or at least not a lot of dictation work.

It says something about me that I'd rather dictate code one letter at a time for four days straight than click pause and play a few times in a big MIDI file, but here it is, so you won't have to repeat the feat. Enjoy!

## Exercise definitions
Exercises are defined in the ~/.voicetrainer/exercises folder. They are written in LilyPond, though with a little customization of my own. Namely, they accept variables to make it easy to change the exercise without having to write hundreds of exercise definitions for all the possibilities.

The parameters are:
* ${pitch} - pitch with octave attached (ex: c', usage: \transpose c ${pitch} { c e g | })
* ${pitch_noheight} - just the pitch, for use in chordmode (ex: c, usage: \chordmode { ${pitch_noheight}:m })
* ${sound} - vocal, for use in lyricsmode (ex: Mi, usage: \lyricsmode { ${sound} })
* ${tempo} - bpm, for midi tempo (ex: 140, usage: \tempo ${temp}=4)

Then there's the sheeton, sheetoff, midion and midioff variables which are used to differentiate between midi and visual output. See existing exercises for examples.

These parameters are not optional, though you might ignore a few by placing them in a comment.

## Examples
See https://github.com/nihlaeth/voicetrainerdata for exercise and song examples.

## Dependencies
* python >= 3.5.1
* pillow
* tk/tcl
* lilypond (I used the dev version)
* pmidi
* fluidsynth or other alsamidi synth

## Installation
```
pip install .
```

## Usage
```
voicetrainer
```

## Todo
* tweak pmidi settings (shorter sleep after midi end)
* document song feature and lily comment settings
* refactor export to be in MainWindow and file menu
* refactor mixins to use __ instead of ex_ and so_

## Problems
* it's possible to play 2 midi streams at the same time with the right timing

## Planned features
* select instruments for midi songs
* compile exercise before it's started
